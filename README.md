# GriftlandsCrossCharacterCampaign

 A mod that allows you to play as other characters in Griftlands

## How does it work?

This mod adds 3 mutators, that allows you to play as the characters in Griftlands.

You can also set the outfit of each character and apply the mutator. Then you can make that character wear the old character's outfit.

This simply allows you to play a character(with their unique deck, grafts, and mechanics) in other character's story. It doesn't change any quests to reflect on the changes. Sometimes picking an option that doesn't make sense will cause the game to crash, so don't trade your non-existing lucky coin with Krog's weighted coin.

This mod also adds another mutator that allows coin grafts to show up as a generic graft reward. Only useful when playing as Rook, obviously.

## How to install?

With the official mod update, you can read about how to set up mods [here](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/116914-early-mod-support/).

1. Find `[user]/AppData/Roaming/Klei/Griftlands/` folder on your computer, or `[user]/AppData/Roaming/Klei/Griftlands_testing/` if you're on experimental. Find the folder with all the autogenerated files, log.txt, and `saves` directory.
2. Create a new folder called `mods` if you haven't already.
3. Clone this repository into that folder.
4. The `modinit.lua` file should be under `.../mods/[insert_repo_name_here]`.
5. Volia! Now the mod should work.

## CHANGELOG

### Update 1

* A new mutator called "Rewardable Coins". Enable this mutator to allow Rook to acquire non-default coin outside of his campaign! Coins will show up as a generic graft reward sometimes.
* Update the UI of pick graft screen so that coin grafts will show up as correct color and correct description.(Still incorrect icon right now, but there's little I can do about it.)
