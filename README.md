# Cross Character Campaign

A mod that allows you to play as other characters in Griftlands.

## How does it work?

This mod adds 3 mutators, that allows you to play as the characters in Griftlands.

You can also set the outfit of each character and apply the mutator. Then you can make that character wear the old character's outfit.

This simply allows you to play a character(with their unique deck, grafts, and mechanics) in other character's story. It doesn't change any quests to reflect on the changes. Sometimes picking an option that doesn't make sense will cause the game to crash, so don't trade your non-existing lucky coin with Krog's weighted coin.

This mod also adds another mutator that allows coin grafts to show up as a generic graft reward. Only useful when playing as Rook, obviously.

**Notice! The latest version is no longer backwards compatible! If you're on the main branch and haven't moved to experimental, use the "legacy" branch of the source code. On that branch it will never be updated again.**

## How to install?

### Directly fron GitHub

With the official mod update, you can read about how to set up mods at https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/116914-early-mod-support/.

1. Find `[user]/AppData/Roaming/Klei/Griftlands/` folder on your computer, or `[user]/AppData/Roaming/Klei/Griftlands_testing/` if you're on experimental. Find the folder with all the autogenerated files, log.txt, and `saves` directory. If you are on Steam, open the folder that starts with `steam-`. If you are on Epic, open the folder that contains only hexadecimal code.
2. Create a new folder called `mods` if you haven't already.
3. Clone this repository into that folder.
4. The `modinit.lua` file should be under `.../mods/[insert_repo_name_here]`.
5. Volia! Now the mod should work.

## CHANGELOG

### 1.1.1

* Minor update that makes the localization loading part in the OnPreLoad function.

### 1.1.0

* Workshop support!
* Added preview icon.
* Made it compatible with the latest experimental version(version 429468). This means that the old version probably won't work anymore.

### 1.0.3

* Remove an unnecessary dependency, as it causes problems in Experimental.
* Fix bug where playing a game without mutators unlocked will cause the game to crash.
* Changed "Japanese" "localization" to Simplified Chinese localization, since there's now actually Chinese in the game. Also updated the translation for Grafts.
* Add Traditional Chinese localization. They are close enough anyways, might as well do it.

### 1.0.2

* Adds "Japanese" "localization".
* Adds icons to the new mutators.

### 1.0.1

* Changed all Sal's brawl grafts to the general series, so other characters can use them.

### 1.0.0

* A new mutator called "Rewardable Coins". Enable this mutator to allow Rook to acquire non-default coin outside of his campaign! Coins will show up as a generic graft reward sometimes.
* Update the UI of pick graft screen so that coin grafts will show up as correct color and correct description.(Still incorrect icon right now, but there's little I can do about it.)
